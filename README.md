### vdsl-router

This repository contains my very personal DSL router configuration based
on OpenWrt on a TP-Link TL-WDR4900 and the VDSL modem DrayTek Vigor 130
set to MPoA mode.

Important OpenWrt configuration links I used:

* [Network Setup w/ PPPoE](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network#protocol_pppoe_ppp_over_ethernet)
* [IPv6 Setup](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network6)

Another procedure I followed was the regdomain fix shown here:
